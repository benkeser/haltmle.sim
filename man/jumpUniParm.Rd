\usage{
jumpUniParm(x, njumpLower = 1, njumpUpper = 5, jumpLower = -2,
  jumpUpper = 2, jumpLoc = function(x, njump) {     quantile(x, seq(0, 1,
  length = njump + 1)) })
}
\description{
Generate parameters for \code{jumpUni}. Here jumpLoc is a function that takes x and njump as input and outputs 
the locations of jumps. By contrast, when jumpLoc is fed into jumpUni, it is just a vector
of numbers. See source code for how exactly it works.
